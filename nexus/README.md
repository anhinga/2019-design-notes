The **nexus of the system** should be an engine which allows
  * comfortable interactive experiments;
  * machine learning experiments taking advantage of the current state of machine learning frameworks.

Mostly, it should be a **standard DMM two-stroke engine** (or, more generallly, a neuromorphic two-stroke engine which might incorporate different temporal and hierarchical scales), shaped around **flattening and reshaping of V-values**:
