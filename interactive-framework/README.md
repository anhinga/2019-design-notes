# Interactive framework for developing, editing, and experimenting with neuromorphic systems with vector-like flows

In recent years our group created a number of prototypes in this general direction under

https://github.com/anhinga/fluid

and 

https://github.com/jsa-aerial/DMM

Also I started to conduct some relevant experiments under

https://github.com/anhinga/2019-python-drafts

Here we'll try to sketch how the overall framework of this kind should look (from the user viewpoint and from the viewpoint of software architecture).

## History

[History.md](History.md) describes own relevant prototypes for neuromorphic dataflow systems with vector-like flows (or their pieces) in recent years.
