# Past thoughts summary

Here I am trying to record the evolution of my thinking about DMM synthesis.

## Before 2016 - not thinking about them as neural nets (only thinking about them as continuously deformable programs)

## Starting from 2016 - keeping in mind that DMMs are generalized neural nets

## Starting from 2019 - first experiments with training the sparse networks
