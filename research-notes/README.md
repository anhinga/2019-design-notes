### Research notes

As a side effect of this design process, some more long-term research fragments emerge.

This is the subdirectory for those fragments (which mostly aim for subsequent versions, and not for the one current under development).

Title:

_Dataflow matrix machines:_
  * _duality between **W** and its input;_
  * _shader-style non-linear component_

---

Abstract:
  * We look at the intriguing natural duality between **W and Y**. This might eventually result in novel self-referential mechanisms in DMMs. 
  * We also note that thinking about the non-linear part of the network as a shader might be quite fruitful. 
  * It was observed before that compositional pattern-producing networks have shader architecture.
